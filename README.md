In this project, we have build a face recognition model by using the Eigenfaces Algorithm which relies on the concept of Principal Component Analysis (a.k.a PCA) for creating Eigenfaces for the given image dataset. We further extended this approach to "Traffic Sign Recognition", which we would like to call it "Eigensigns".
